### Introduction

Keno is a popular gambling game with similarities to a lottery or bingo. Players place a bet and choose anywhere from one to twenty numbers between 1 and 80, inclusive. Once the players have chosen their numbers, the game generates twenty random numbers between 1 and 80, and players receive a payoff based on how many numbers they picked that matched the chosen numbers.
For example, if a player picked seven numbers and all seven were chosen (very unlikely!), she might win around $10.000 for a ten dollar bet. The actual payoffs are based on the probabilities of hitting _k_ numbers out of _n_ chosen.
